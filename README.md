This project is a gallery application inspired by Unsplash, where users can view, search, and manage images. It was created as a submission for a challenge on DevChallenges.io.

- **Demo**: You can see the live demo [here](https://unsplash-gallery.vercel.app).
- **Experience**: Working on this project was a great learning experience. I got to deepen my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS, as well as improve my backend skills with Express and MongoDB.
- **Learnings**: I learned how to create a full-stack application with a React frontend and Express backend, and how to deploy it seamlessly on Vercel.
- **Wisdom**: Consistent practice and taking on challenges outside your comfort zone are key to growth.
